## Build

Building PDF files from LaTeX sources requires a complete LaTeX distribution installed on your computer, e.g. TeX Live or MiKTeX. See the [LaTeX compendium on Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installation) for a comprehensive overview and installation instructions. The following steps have been tested on Ubuntu Linux.

### Using _Make_

Simply type `make` into your command line and open the PDF. This step requires _Make_.

### Using _latexmk_

You can also use _latexmk_ by typing:

```shell
latexmk main
```

After building, you may want to clean your environment with `latexmk -c`.

### Manual compiling

Alternatively, you can manually compile from sources. The template is recommended to be compiled with _pdflatex_:

```shell
pdflatex main
makeindex -s main.ist -t main.alg -o main.acr main.acn
pdflatex main
```
